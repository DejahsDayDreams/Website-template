# Website-template
A HTML and CSS template website

As a UI designer, creating a professional website template that adheres to strict standards can indeed be challenging but achievable with the right approach and key elements. To meet these requirements, I was tasked with developing a website template that not only looks professional but also complies with strict W3C rules.

To begin, I was provided with a wireframe outlining the layout specifications for the template. This served as a blueprint for the design process, ensuring that the final product would meet the necessary standards and expectations.

In designing the template, I focused on employing web-safe colors, DIV tags, and web-safe fonts. These elements are crucial for ensuring accessibility across different platforms and devices, catering to a wide range of users.

By adhering to these guidelines and implementing key design principles, I was able to create a website template that is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and compliant with W3C standards.


Color Scheme


I chose blue for the template as blue is a prominent color in website design, and it has varied psychological meanings depending on the setting, such as:

•	Blue is also connected with trust, dependability, and professionalism. It is frequently used in websites that provide financial or legal services, as well as in the logos of numerous well-known corporations.
•	Blue can also be used to create a calm and peaceful ambiance. It is frequently used on websites selling products or services relating to the water, sky, or other natural surroundings.
•	Blue is frequently associated with peace, tranquillity, and relaxation. It is widely used in websites that offer health, wellness, and meditation services.
